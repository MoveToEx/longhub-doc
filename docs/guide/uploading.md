# Uploading

## Prerequesties

There are some requirements on the image:

1. Image file should not exceed 4 MiB. This limit is considered sufficient for most images, especially ones that are mostly used as stickers. If you find server returning `413 Content Too Large`, this means you have probably exceeded this limit. Try compressing your image and uploading again.
2.  Avoid disgusting content. It may sound absurd for images centered on insulting others, but insulting is not necessarily equal to being disgusting. Spilling the ashes of someone's mother onto the sky is apparently different from showing a dick.
3. Check for potential duplicate using [Find Similar](https://longhub.top/post/similar) and [Search](https://longhub.top/post/search) page. Do not upload an image if there's already one containing nearly identical content. Note that due to its underlying algorithm, the Find Similar page may not produce accurate result, especially when the given image has gone through some sort of adjustment (like incresing saturation, applying filter, etc). Therefore, Search is preferred when checking for duplicates. For images not containing any text, try to tag them and search for the tags.

## Tips

You can add multiple images to your upload queue by dragging them onto the selection area or selecting them in the file selection dialog.  

The dragging area supports pasting with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>. 

You can search for a condition in the upload page by entering metadata and clicking on the third button (_Quick search_).

Note that when entering tags, the text being entered does not count as a tag.
You have to press enter or select a tag from the dropdown menu (making the text become a chip) to actually enter a tag.
