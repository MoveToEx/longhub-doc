# Uploading

## Before uploading

There are several notes:  

- Avoid disgusting content. It may sound absurd for images centered on insulting others, but we still hope you could avoid images that most people would not like to see.  
- Check for potential dups using Find Similar. Do not upload an image if there's already one containing nearly identical content.  

## When uploading

You can add multiple images to your upload queue by dragging them onto the selection area or selecting them in the popup dialog.

When uploading, you can make sure there's no dups by searching for all conditions you have filled into the inputs.


Aggressive is a rather subjective field, and it is hard to guarantee a uniform standard for this. Do your best.  

Note that when entering tags, the text being entered does not count as a tag.
You have to press enter or select a tag from the dropdown menu (making the text become a chip) to actually enter a tag.  

The rating component used in Aggressiveness can be set to 0 by clicking the already selected value again.
