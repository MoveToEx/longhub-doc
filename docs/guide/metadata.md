:::tip
Keep in mind that all these guidelines serve for the same purpose of making posts as easily found through search page as possible. If you find any of these guidelines doing the opposite, violate them if necessary.

## Text

Text refers to the text that appears in the image.  

- Text may not contain space characters. If there's visible spaces between two characters, ignore them.
- Correct typos if there are any.
- For blocks of text that are put on different areas of an image, blocks can be ordered arbitrarily, while text of each block should remain ordered.
- If an image does not contain identifiable text, leave the input box blank.
- If an image contains languages other than Simplified Chinese and English, translate them into proper Chinese equivalent.
- If an image contains emojis as parts of its text, replace the emoji with proper representations.
- Text may not contain punctuation, unless the punctuation is used not only for separating purposes (like "@" used to mention someone in group chat).
- If an image is animated and contains different text between frames, enter all of them. [example](https://longhub.top/post/f580918a-8c2e-4a20-b0ae-6a13c08cddce)
- If an image contains too many repeated words, you can ignore most of them and leave only one. [example](https://longhub.top/post/47b01690-e620-4dd4-9d7c-a7f20805106d)

## Tag

Tag is a field representing elements and characteristics of an image.  

- Tags must be written in English and must not contain characters other than digits, lowercase letters and underline(_). Illegal tag names will cause an error when entering.
- If an image contains elements from a certain topic (game, anime, comic series, etc), tag it with the English translation of the topic.
- If an image is mostly used to convey a certain kind of emotion, include that emotion as a tag. (e.g. `disapproving`, `jealous`, ...)
- If you don't know how to tag an image, tag it with `tagme`.

## Aggressiveness

Aggressiveness (abbr. `aggr`) describes how violently an image insults other people. 

- Should be a multiple of 0.5, like `2.0` or `3.5`.
- Refer to other tagged images for your reference.
- Don't be afraid to give a 0 rating. If an image is considered mostly neutral, 0 aggr is the right choice.
- Also don't easily give high ratings. Do not decide on a high aggr for a few dirty words or so. There are images of high aggr on the site for your reference.
