# Metadata

Metadata of a post consists of text, tag and rating.

:::tip
Keep in mind that all these guidelines serve for the same purpose of making posts as easily found through search page as possible. If you find any of these guidelines doing the opposite, violate them if necessary.

## Text

Text refers to the text that appears in the image.  
In most cases, this field should contain every identifiable character except for punctuation characters. There're exceptions however. Read the following lines for details.

- No spacing characters. (Space, Tab, Enter, etc)
- Correct typos.
- For blocks of text on different areas of an image, they can be ordered arbitrarily, and text of each block should remain ordered.
- If an image does not contain identifiable text, leave the input box blank.
- If an image contains languages other than Simplified Chinese and English, translate them into proper Chinese equivalent.
- If an image contains emojis as parts of its text, replace the emoji with proper textual representations.
- Text may not contain punctuation, unless the punctuation is used not only for separating purposes (like "@" used to mention someone in group chat).
- If an image is animated and contains different text between frames, enter all of them. [example](https://longhub.top/post/f580918a-8c2e-4a20-b0ae-6a13c08cddce)
- If an image contains too many repeated words, you can ignore the repeating ones. [example](https://longhub.top/post/47b01690-e620-4dd4-9d7c-a7f20805106d)
- If an image contains text that's commonly considered useless for searching and indexing (which means basically no one would search for this image with that text), you may ignore it. [example](https://longhub.top/post/c8c1a25b-8fc8-4c74-97e2-0d96f3e06b4e)

## Tag

Tag is a field representing elements and characteristics of an image.  

- Tags must be written in English and must not contain characters other than digits, lowercase letters and underline(_). Illegal tag names will cause an error when entering.
- If an image contains elements from a certain topic (game, anime, comic series, etc), tag it with the English translation of the topic.
- If an image is mostly used to convey a certain kind of emotion, include that emotion as a tag. (e.g. `disapproving`, `jealous`, ...)
- Abbreviation is allowed as long as this abbr is well known. For example, `netease_cloud_music` is shortened to `ncm`, and `fireboy_and_watergirl` may not be replaced with `faw`.
- If you don't know how to tag an image, tag it with `tagme` as a placeholder.

## Rating

Rating describes how violently insulting an image is.  

There was another field called `aggr` that used to achieve similar functions. But `aggr` had 20 possible values, while `rating` has only 3. This replacement happened so as to eliminate discrepancy between users regarding how insulting an image is.

- Must be one of `none`, `moderate`, `violent`.
- If an image is considered neutral or friendly and does not convey any form of aggression, rate it as `none`.
- If an image uses relatively mild disapproving tone, rate it as `moderate`.
- If an image uses fierce words to abuse others, rate it as `violent`.
