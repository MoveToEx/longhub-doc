In this case, browsers will receive an <code>image/png</code> as MIME type for GIFs dragged from them.</p><p>Currently there&#39;s no way of solving this. We suggest saving the image to gif files and dragging the file from your system explorer.</p><h4 id="is-it-possible-to-change-the-image-of-a-post" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#is-it-possible-to-change-the-image-of-a-post"><span>Is it possible to change the image of a post?</span></a></h4><p>No. A post cannot have its image updated.
